					<h3 class="heading-about">ABOUT THE COLLEGE</h3>
					<p>The inception of Ramananda College in 1945 was the beginning of providing higher education to the otherwise marginalized youths of this locality. The “Temple Town” Bishnupur, a Sub-Divisional Head Quarter is endowed so far with this only co-educational Degree College, which has been serving for more than half a century as the Alma Mater of thousands of students coming from rural Bengal.

The proposal to establish a centre of higher education was initially made by Sri Ramnalini Chakraborty, freedom fighter and social worker of Bishnupur. Initiative was taken by Sri Radhagobinda Roy, founder Principal of this college and Ex-minister, Government of West Bengal and many other eminent personalities of the town and the district. Fund was generated by the contributions of Sri Ramnalani Chakraborty (Rs. 25,000/-), Koley family (Rs. 36,000/-), Sri Anil Kumar Bhattacharya (Rs. 10,000/-), members of the Friends’ Union Club (Rs. 10,000/-) and by the donations of the common people. The college was named after the illustrious son of the district of Bankura, Sri Ramananda Chattopadhyay, noted journalists, editor and scholar.

Ramananda Chattopadhyay was the editor, publisher and owner of the “Modern Review”, a high grade illustrated monthly magazine published in English and “Prabasi”, a Bengali organ, published in the vernacular. He was pre-eminently an editor although during his useful life he was been associated with many reform movements.

The sapling of the past has become the full-grown tree of the present. It fulfils the academic need of the students and nourishes them with the knowledge of real value. The college was initially affiliated to the University of Calcutta and later on to the University of Burdwan and now under the affiliation of the Bankura University. The college is recognized by the UGC under 2f and 12B.

The college, with best academic standard, offers twenty Honours & Programme at UG level and five courses at P.G. level. Every year some students secure ranks in the University Final Examinations. The rate of success in the University Final Examination is more than 90%. Along with this excellent academic performance the students are involved in social activities like Extension Programme, Adult Education Programme, organizing Health Camp, Plantation Programme, etc. With equal enthusiasm the students serve the nation by being an integral part of N.S.S. & N.C.C. units of the college.

In 2015, the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) reaccredited (2nd Cycle) the College with 2.75 score. Further with the introduction of different Post Graduate Courses in Science and Humanities the College has become a constituent college of the Bankura University. Now the College is complaint with the vision of RUSA.

There are four electrical generator sets in the campus if emergencies arise. Selected students are provided with sports goods for participation in Inter-University and State Level competitions.
